	<h3 style="color:#7B9E0D;margin-top:10px;">
		TECHNICAL
	</h3>
	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		Striving to be an exceptional developer but focusing on mobile development. My goal is to become a guru in both iOS development and Android development. At the same time I like to search for new things to learn. In the past I have started projects regarding Android and IOS. I am currently learning MEAN stack on my own time. Since the industry is constantly evolving, a developer cannot be stagnant. Even by the time I am fifty years old, I will keep learning.

	<h3 style="color:#7B9E0D;margin-top:30px;">
		PROCESS ORIENTED
	</h3>
	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		A companies process is an aspect that I am obessed with. This abstract part of a company is such a crucial part that sometimes can be overlooked. At any workplace I am fortunate to be in, I constantly look for ways to enhance the process to achieve better output.  Why shouldn't a company change their process if they know that a more efficient route can create a better outcome? The topic around the process of a company is one that will never have a definitive answer because each company is different. That is why it is such an fascinating topic.

	<h3 style="color:#7B9E0D;margin-top:30px;">
		BUSINESS ORIENTED
	</h3>
	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		Client facing projects are ones I enjoy the most. Many times in these projects you can see an how the product will impact the target audience. This accomplished feeling of being able to produce something that the average consumer can enjoy is amazing.
