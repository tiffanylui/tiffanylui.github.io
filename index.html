		WORDS TO DESCRIBE ME

		The Different Sides of Me 
	</h3>
	<h3 style="color:#7B9E0D;margin-top:10px;">
		TECHNICAL
	</h3>
	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		Striving to be an exceptional developer but focusing on mobile development. My goal is to become a guru in both iOS development and Android development. At the same time I like to search for new things to learn. In the past I have started projects regarding Android and IOS. I am currently learning MEAN stack on my own time. Since the industry is constantly evolving, a developer cannot be stagnant. Even by the time I am fifty years old, I will keep learning.

	<h3 style="color:#7B9E0D;margin-top:30px;">
		PROCESS
	</h3>
	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		A companies process is an aspect that I am obessed with. This abstract part of a company is such a crucial part that sometimes can be overlooked. At any workplace I am fortunate to be in, I constantly look for ways to enhance the process to achieve better output.  Why shouldn't a company change their process if they know that a more efficient route can create a better outcome? The topic around the process of a company is one that will never have a definitive answer because each company is different. That is why it is such an fascinating topic.

	<h3 style="color:#7B9E0D;margin-top:30px;">
		BUSINESS
	</h3>
	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		Client facing projects are ones I enjoy the most. During many occasians you can see the direct impact to the target audience. This accomplished feeling of being able to produce something that the average consumer can enjoy is amazing.

		Main Personal Project

		WearIt Android & IOS <a href="https://github.com/tiffanylui/WearIt" style="float:right; font-size:12px; color:#7B9E0D">Github README</a>

	<h5 style="margin-top:10px;">
		Android & IOS application that advises the user of the weather condition and what to wear for that the day. 
		My goal of this application is to have a personalized approach when users are interpreting the weather. At the same time, this can allow users to acquire important data that they did not even know they needed.</br></br>
		In future releases, there are plans to begin user customization for a more personal relationship.
