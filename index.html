			My goal is to become a guru in both iOS development and Android development. At the same time I like to search for new things to learn. In the past I have started projects regarding Android and IOS. I am currently learning MEAN stack on my own time. Since the industry is constantly evolving, a developer cannot be stagnant. Even by the time I am fifty years old, I will keep learning.

		A company's process is an aspect that I am obsessed with.

		<br>
		<p class="grey">
			This abstract part of a company is such a crucial part that sometimes can be overlooked. At any workplace I am fortunate to be in, I constantly look for ways to enhance the process to achieve better output.  Why shouldn't a company change their process if they know that a more efficient route can create a better outcome? The topic around the process of a company is one that will never have a definitive answer because each company is different. That is why it is such an fascinating topic.
